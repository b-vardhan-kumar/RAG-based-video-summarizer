 Here is how to install FFM back on Windows 10 and 11 in 3 minutes' time. First, go onto the official FFM back website. Then scroll down and select the Windows Builds option. I'll select the first one. You'll notice two main zip packages that will interest you. The Essentials and the 4 package. I'll choose the Essentials, but you can choose anything you need for your purposes. If you're in doubt, pick the 4 version. Once the package finishes downloading, extract the files to your chosen location. In my case, I'll extract the files to my desktop. The files inside the folder should look like this. Select the extracted folder and change its name to FFM back. Like this. Now you'll have to move this folder onto your main system drive. Drag and drop the FFM back folder onto your main system drive directory, like so. Now we'll have to add FFM back to path. Enter the System Environment Fireballs Editor like this. Then click on the Environment Fireballs button. Now we will add the FFM back folder to System Path so that we can access it using the command line. This step is very important. Click the Edit button under the User Fireballs and then click on New. Here you have to type the exact file path to the FFM back folder we just copied over to the C drive. Make sure that you don't make a mistake, otherwise it won't work. After successfully finished the process, the FFM back folder should now be added to path. We'll close all these windows now and verify our installation. To do this, open up a System command prompt and type in FFM back, then press Enter. After a few seconds, if you've done everything correctly, you should see that the tool is now accessible from the System Terminal. That's it, a job well done.
